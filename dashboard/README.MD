# üè†üîç Rent Comparison Dashboard

The Rent Comparison Dashboard is a Streamlit-based web application designed for comparing rental properties.
It provides users with insights into the real estate market,
allowing them to evaluate and compare their own rental offers with the current market trends.

## üî® Usage

**Run and install virtual environment:**

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

**Run the Dashboard**:

```
streamlit run dashboard//streamlit_app.py
```

The output renders in the OS's default web browser.
You can share the outcome via the local or network URL.

## ü™ì Configuration

Simply modify the config file: `dashboard\config.py`.
Important arguments include:

```
DATA:
    "user_data_path": ...,
    "market_data_datetime": ...,

MODEL:
    "model_path": ...,

```

## ü§ñ Testing

Currently, there are no automated tests for the application.

## Troubleshoots

- When the module `config.py` is loaded, the warnings are invoked each time, instead of just once in the runtime.
- Ensure the `YOUR_OFFERS_PATH` environment variable is set correctly to avoid FileNotFoundError during data loading.
