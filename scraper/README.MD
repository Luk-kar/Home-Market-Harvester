# üè†üîç OLX/Otodom flats offer scraper

A Python script that scrapes the flats offers data in Poland from the `olx.pl` and the `otodom.pl`.

The output is in the form of a table in a CSV file.

It functions without any authentication e.g. user sign-ins/ API tokens and keys.

The script has been tested and verified to be working as expected
for scraping a small volume of data for personal use or small to mid-organizations.

It is advised to use a VPN during running the script.

The script was tested on the Chrome 119 Windows 10

## üî® Usage

Run and install virtual environment:

```
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Run the scraper to test out

```
python scraper
```

Run the scraper using the command line interface:

```
python -m scraper [location_query] [area_radius] [scraped_offers_cap]
```

- location_query: Location query for scraping. E.g., `'Warszawa'`.
- area_radius: Radius of the area for scraping in kilometers. Valid options are `0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75`.
- scraped_offers_cap: Maximum number of offers to scrape. E.g., `1, 10, 100, 500...`

Example

```
python -m scraper "Warszawa" 25 10
```

This command will scrape up to `10 offers` from a `25 km radius` around `Warsaw`.

The output is saved in the `data\raw\{timestamp}_{place}\{site_1}.csv, {site_2}.csv, ...`
For example: `data\raw\2023_11_27_19_41_45_Mierzƒôcice__Bƒôdzi≈Ñski__≈ölƒÖskie\olx.pl.csv`
